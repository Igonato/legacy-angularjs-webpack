# (Legacy) AngularJS Webpack Setup

**work in progress, but everything is mostly together ðŸŽ‰**

AngularJS Webpack setup that is friendly to dated projects. You can use
this for a new project just fine *if for some reason you want to start a new
project using AngularJS in %current_year%*.

To test the setup [legacy-angularjs-app] was made. Please, feel free to
suggest what else could be included there!

To quickly play with the setup:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Igonato/legacy-angularjs-webpack.git
cd legacy-angularjs-webpack
npm install
npm start
```
